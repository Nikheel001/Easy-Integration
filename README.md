# Easy-Integration
Develop application on any platform in multiple programming languages using .NET-CORE.

Idea here is, that to run different language code during current execution,
start a new process for that different language code

because C# provides asynchronous programming facility we can do much more things...
like main process fetches input and other processes manipulate it differently.
or database/query process in different language and data representation in different language.

# Note here that 
I am not talking about fork() (current process's copy)
I am trying to start a new process (see in example i am running python code in C# code execution.)
This can be extended too.
